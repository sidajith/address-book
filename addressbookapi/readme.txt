I have implemented and created unit tests for all of the functions. 
I made subfunctions that avoided the REST syntax unless the function was trivial. 
I incuded all sources I used wherever applicable.
Additionally, I have included how I limit each field of the address book.
The fields I chose were name (id), phone number, email, home address, and bio description.
